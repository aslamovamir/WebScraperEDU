            Accreditation
            
            
            
            
            
               
            
            
            The University of South Florida College of Education is proud to be nationally accredited
               by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). Accreditation is a voluntary process designed to ensure high-quality practices
               through a rigorous evaluation process consisting of self-evaluation, on-site accreditation
               evaluators and ongoing assessment. &nbsp; In the fall of 2020, the College of Education on USF's Tampa campus underwent a continuing
               accreditation review by CAEP. Accreditation reviews take place every seven years.
                &nbsp;These programs in the College of Education,&nbsp;which&nbsp;prepare teachers and other P-12 school professionals,
               were reviewed by CAEP in the fall of 2020. These programs are also approved by the
               Florida Department of Education to confer state licensure/endorsement.
            
            
            Additionally, the School Psychology Program is accredited by the&nbsp;American Psychological
               Association Committee on Accreditation, and is recognized by the&nbsp;National Association
               of School Psychologists.&nbsp;CAEP requires that accredited institutions&nbsp;annually provide data on eight measures
               of program effectiveness:
            
            
            
               
               Impact on P-12 learning and development&nbsp;
               
               Indicators of teaching effectiveness
               
               Satisfaction of employers and employment milestones
               
               Satisfaction of completers
               
               Graduation Rates
               
               Ability of completers to meet licensing (certification) and any additional state requirements
               
               Ability of completers to be hired in education positions for which they have prepared
               
               Student loan default rates and other consumer information
               
            
            
            The following 2018-19 data sets for the measures listed above are compiled from: Florida
               Department of Education Annual Program Performance Reports (APPRs) for each licensure
               program, which include data on certification exam pass rates, employment and job retention,
               impact on P-12 student learning (Value Added Modeling or “VAM”) and teacher evaluations
               for our graduates; satisfaction surveys conducted by the College of Education of our
               alumni and employers of our graduates; university databases.&nbsp;These data reflect programs on the Tampa campus only. Following the fall 2020 consolidation
               of USF's three campuses into “One USF,” data in the future will be aggregated to reflect
               College of Education programs offered on all three campuses and will be posted when
               available.&nbsp;
