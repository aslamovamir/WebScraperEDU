            Community Engagement
            
            
            
            
            
               
            
            
            The Carnegie Foundation defines community engagement as “collaboration between institutions
                  of higher education and their larger communities (local, regional/state, national,
                  global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context
                  of partnership and reciprocity. The purpose of community engagement is the partnership of college and university knowledge
                  and resources with those of the public and private sectors to enrich scholarship,
                  research, and creative activity; enhance curriculum, teaching and learning; prepare
                  educated, engaged citizens; strengthen democratic values and civic responsibility;
                  address critical societal issues; and contribute to the public good.”
            
            
            
            The College of Education views community engagement as an important component in all
               three areas of faculty work—teaching, research &amp;&nbsp;scholarship, and service. Our faculty
               have developed numerous&nbsp;innovative service-learning courses that not only provide
               our students with hands-on learning opportunities, but that also create a&nbsp;real-world
               impact. While participating in these opportunities, our students&nbsp;provide valuable
               service to our local and global partners, and become better equipped to succeed.
