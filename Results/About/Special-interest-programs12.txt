            Call Me MiSTER is a College of Education initiative based on the USF St. Petersburg
               campus that recruits men of color to get their undergraduate degree and teacher certification
               or a Masterâ€™s of Arts degree in Teaching. The program is conducted in partnership
               with Pinellas County Schools. Men desiring to teach and serve as role models in urban
               elementary or middle schools are encouraged to apply.

            Go Teach Bulls
            
            The Go Teach Project, hosted by the College Football Playoff Foundation, aims to give
               athletic and academic departments a platform and the tools needed to assist with the
               recruitment of qualified student-athletes into the teaching profession. The USF College
               of Education and USF Athletics have joined the project to encourage more USF student
               athletes to consider a rewarding career in teaching.
