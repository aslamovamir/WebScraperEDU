            Mission
            
            United, We Shape the Future of Education
            
            The University of South Florida College of Education is a community of faculty, students,
               and staff focused on transforming lives through the promotion of equity, social justice,
               and improved outcomes for students and communities particularly those that have been
               underserved. With boundless energy and the collective power of our community, our
               research, degree programs, and local and global partnerships are focused on solving
               the most complex problems of a diverse society and on preparing practitioners to be
               agents of change. Our community embraces and promotes the values of diversity, equity,
               and inclusion. Students in our College are active learners who participate in sustained
               immersive experiences that develop knowledge and skills to advance their communities,
               conquer persistent problems of practice, and advance knowledge.
