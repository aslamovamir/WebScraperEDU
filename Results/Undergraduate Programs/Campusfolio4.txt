            As of Fall 2020, the USF College of Education has discontinued the use of Chalk and
               Wire as an e-portfolio system for students. Currently, we are in the process of transitioning
               to a new e-portfolio system: CampusFolio.
            
            
            This new system will allow students to upload critical tasks required to demonstrate
               competencies for National, Regional, State, and Institutional requirements. The e-portfolio
               system is purposeful in the collection, analysis, and reporting of student portfolios,
               test scores, and field placement dataâ€”and is available free of charge&nbsp;for USF faculty
               and students.

            CampusFolio Help Desk
            
            To assist our students, faculty, and staff with the use of CampusFolio, the College
               of Education has a Help Desk that is available Monday through Friday. The Help Desk
               offers a full support system of seminars, email inquiries, and phone assistance to
               help you learn to use the system and complete your e-portfolio.
            
            
            This new system will be phased in according to program direction. The final timeline
               is dependent upon many factors, please check in with your program to find out when
               your program will be transitioned. We will be providing periodic updates on this website.
