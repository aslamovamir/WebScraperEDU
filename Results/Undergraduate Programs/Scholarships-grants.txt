            College can be expensive — which is why we offer generous scholarships to high-achieving
               students. Scholarships are based on academic merit and do not need to be repaid. The
               USF College of Education is proud to award more than $400,000 in scholarships to our
               students each year through private funding.
            
            
            Students seeking financial assistance to pay for their education may also qualify
               for grants.&nbsp;Grants are need-based money that does not have to be repaid and are funded
               by Federal, state, or institutional resources.&nbsp;

            Applying for College of Education Scholarships
            
            Apply for College of Education scholarships through the AwardSpring&nbsp;scholarship database. AwardSpring allows students to apply for USF scholarships by completing a brief
               questionnaire that shows a list of scholarship(s) they may qualify for based on responses.
               Some scholarships consider financial need and require that students complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).&nbsp;
