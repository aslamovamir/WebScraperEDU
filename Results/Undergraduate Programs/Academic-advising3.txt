            As an undergraduate student, we encourage you to meet with your academic advisor each
               term. Academic advisors can support you in exploring the major to career connection,
               understanding your degree audit, declaring your intended major, creating a course
               schedule, identifying important campus resources, and finding ways you can get engaged
               on campus!
