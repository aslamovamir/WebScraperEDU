               Coronavirus Updates
               The University of South Florida continues to closely monitor the evolving coronavirus
                  (COVID-19) outbreak. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff is our
                  highest priority as university leaders work closely with local, state and federal
                  agencies to share the most updated information. USF's Coronavirus Updates website
                  is intended to help inform plans in the coming weeks and provide important health
                  guidance from our USF Health experts. Please review this website to receive the latest
                  updates and information.
