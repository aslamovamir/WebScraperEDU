            Graduate certificates are designed to provide you with valuable educational experience
               in a more accessible, focused format than traditional graduate degree programs.
            
            
            A&nbsp;certificate is a specialized graduate-level credential reflecting knowledge of the
               most up-to-date research in the selected field. Once completed, the certificate is
               notated on your transcripts, and a USF certificate of completion is awarded. Certificate
               completion increases your competitiveness, enhances your performance, and helps prepare
               you for the changing nature of&nbsp;your field of specialization.&nbsp;
            
            
            Certificates generally take one-two years to complete, depending on course load per
               semester and course schedule offerings.&nbsp;Some certificates can be used to meet some
               of the requirements of a graduate program, depending on the policies of the degree
               program and the university. Completion of a certificate does not imply admission to
               a related program.
